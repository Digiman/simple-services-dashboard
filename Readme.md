# Simple Services Dashboard

Simple service/web application to provide the ability to monitor other services to check their statuses.
Basically it's provided the Health Check dashboard for them (all the services that support this functionality). Services can be configured in the configuration file by adding a new one. Because all the services will use same concepts and URL routes to monitor and get details about the service (by using service template).
